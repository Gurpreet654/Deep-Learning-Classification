# Machine-Learning-Classification
Classification of images
Custemize deep learning model was implimented to classify traffic signs in Germany challenge 

# Dataset
Dataset was direclty loaded from the Kaggle with name of "GTSRB - German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark" link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign?select=Train
The German Traffic Sign Benchmark is a multi-class, single-image classification challenge held at the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2011. We cordially invite researchers from relevant fields to participate: The competition is designed to allow for participation without special domain knowledge. Our benchmark has the following properties:

Single-image, multi-class classification problem
43 classes
More than 50,000 images in total
Large, lifelike database
